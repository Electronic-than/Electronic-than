## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ethan De Vera an international student studying Web Design in DMIT, Northern Alberta Institute of Technology(NAIT)

aiming to graduate and use the skills and knowledge I learned in my program to contribute in the working world.

I enjoy designing and coding websites for myself and others with programs like VS code. 

While I have learned a lot during my 1st year at NAIT, I am still open for more knowledge and excited to further improve my skills.
